# Predicting_imdb_rating_from_movie_posters

This project aims to predict imdb ratings from corresponding movie posters.
We collected a total of 5039 movie posters and corresponding imdb ratings.
We floored the imdb ratings to their nearest integer. Thus, we have 0-9 imdb ratings (classes).
We are treating this as a multi-class classification problem.
